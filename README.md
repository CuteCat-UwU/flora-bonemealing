# flora-bonemealing
A datapack for Minecraft Java edition to make doubling of small flowers possible through bonemeal

The problem is i am very lazy, so right clicking on flowers with bonemeal won't work
Instead place Flower and a bonemeal in crafting grid to get 2 flowers.

This also prolly won't need to be updated unless namespaces change or new flowers get added, which is not gonna happen soon.
